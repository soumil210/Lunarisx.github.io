  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>The Mission</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      The <strong>CanSat competition</strong> is an international educational program organized by
      <strong>ESERO</strong> in collaboration with the <strong>European Space Agency (ESA)</strong>.
      Students are challenged to design, build, and launch a satellite the size of a soda can,
      simulating a real space mission and gaining hands-on experience in aerospace engineering.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Team <strong>Lunaris-X</strong>, from <strong>Keizer Karel College in Amstelveen</strong>,
      is developing a fully functional CanSat that performs environmental measurements,
      transmits flight data to a ground station, and enables in-depth post-flight analysis.

  <section>
    <h2>Mission Objectives</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Primary Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Measure air temperature and air pressure continuously throughout the flight.
          The collected data is transmitted to the ground station during descent and
          stored locally as a fail-safe. Pressure data is converted into altitude,
          allowing reconstruction of the full flight profile and generation of
          detailed graphs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Secondary Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Record the CanSat’s orientation, rotation, and stability using a 9-axis IMU
          consisting of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. By combining
          this data with altitude measurements, a 3D model of the CanSat’s trajectory
          and attitude is reconstructed, resulting in a realistic visualization of
          the flight dynamics during ascent, release, descent, and landing.

  <!-- WHY THIS MISSION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why This Mission?</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Engineering Relevance</h3>
        <p>
          Stability and orientation control are fundamental aspects of all aerospace
          systems, from sounding rockets to satellites. Measuring real-world motion
          allows evaluation of aerodynamic behavior and structural design.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
        <p>
          The 3D reconstruction transforms raw sensor data into a clear and intuitive
          visualization, making otherwise invisible dynamics such as rotation and
          vibration easier to understand and analyze.
