  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>The Mission</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      The <strong>CanSat competition</strong> is an international educational program organized by
      <strong>ESERO</strong> in collaboration with the <strong>European Space Agency (ESA)</strong>.
      Students design, build, and launch a satellite the size of a soda can, simulating a real
      space mission while gaining hands-on experience in aerospace engineering.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Team <strong>Lunaris-X</strong>, from <strong>Keizer Karel College in Amstelveen</strong>,
      is developing a fully functional CanSat capable of environmental measurements,
      live telemetry, and advanced post-flight analysis.

  <!-- MISSION OBJECTIVES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Mission Objectives</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Primary Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Measure air temperature and air pressure continuously throughout the flight.
          The collected data is transmitted to the ground station during descent and
          stored locally as a fail-safe. Pressure data is converted into altitude,
          allowing reconstruction of the complete flight profile.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Secondary Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Record the CanSat’s orientation, rotation, and stability using a 9-axis IMU.
          By combining this data with altitude measurements from the primary mission,
          a 3D reconstruction of the flight path and attitude is created, revealing
          dynamics that are not visible from video recordings alone.

      <h3>Second Generation Design</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to completing our primary and secondary missions, we are proud to 
        present the first-ever second-generation CanSat, representing a major step forward
        in design and functionality. Through extensive research and experimentation,
        we have incorporated newer, faster microcontrollers and more efficient system 
        designs, setting a precedent for future teams. This pioneering approach not only 
        improves performance and reduces costs but also simplifies construction, 
        making advanced CanSat technology more accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        While fully complying with the current competition requirements, we hope that
        the insights gained from our design choices can contribute to the evolution
        of future CanSat designs and inspire improvements in upcoming editions of
        the competition.Second Generation CanSat – A First

  <h2>Why This Approach?</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Engineering Insight</h3>
      <p>
        Iterative design and modernization reflect real aerospace practice, where
        new technologies are constantly integrated to improve performance, efficiency,
        and reliability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Impact on Future Teams</h3>
      <p>
        By exploring more efficient designs and modern components, we aim to provide
        ideas that future CanSat teams can build on, inspiring innovation and raising
        the overall standard of the competition.
